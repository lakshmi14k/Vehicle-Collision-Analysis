**INTRODUCTION**

This repository contains details of the final project completed as part of the course DAMG 7370 - Designing Advanced Data Architecture for Business Intelligence at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Professor Naveen Kuragayala

**OVERVIEW**
The goal of the project is to leverage integrated crash data from the Department of Transportation portals in three major cities: Austin, Chicago, and New York. This effort aims to investigate the complexities of traffic crash incidents, their patterns, contributing variables, and subsequent effects on public safety, with the primary goal of improving urban traffic safety measures. This collaborative initiative highlights the need for a group effort to address pressing issues related to public safety and urban mobility.
